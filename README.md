# 🚦 Traffic Accident Data Analysis

**Task 5 - Prodigy Infotech Data Science Internship**

This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to uncover patterns associated with **road conditions**, **weather**, and **time of day**. The goal is to visualize accident **hotspots** and identify **key contributing factors** to accidents, helping stakeholders enhance road safety measures.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Analyze traffic accident data.
- Identify patterns related to:
  - 🛣️ Road Conditions
  - 🌦️ Weather Conditions
  - 🕒 Time of Day
- Visualize:
  - 📍 Accident hotspots using geospatial plots
  - 📊 Trends and relationships among contributing factors

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes detailed information on traffic accidents, including:
- Location (latitude/longitude)
- Time and date
- Weather conditions
- Road surface condition
- Severity of the accident

> 📌 Dataset Source: [e.g., US Accidents Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Plotly & Folium** – for interactive maps and geospatial visualization
- **NumPy**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- General stats on accident frequency
- Distribution of accidents over time (hour/day/week)
- Analysis of weather and road surface impact
- Identification of peak accident times
- State-wise and city-wise accident distribution

---

## 🗺️ Visualization Highlights

- **Heatmaps** of accident hotspots by location
- **Bar plots** for accident frequency by time, weather, and road conditions
- **Pie charts** and **line graphs** for accident trends
- **Geospatial maps** showing high-risk areas

---

## 🧠 Insights

- Time periods with the highest accident frequency
- Specific weather or road conditions correlated with higher severity
- Areas with consistently high accident rates
